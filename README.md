# Cats Incorpurrate /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\

An assignment to do a list of employees for a company run by 🐈 🐈 🐈 with a filter functionality based on cuteness factor.

Data is served via the Next.js API route after attempts to use Go in the same way failed. Before this I tried to embed the Next.js project inside a Go program according to this setup, but didn't manage to get it to work: [portable-apps-go-nextjs](https://github.com/dstotijn/v0x.nl/blob/master/content/articles/portable-apps-go-nextjs.md)

Aside from focusing on data fetching and sorting functionality I put most focus on responsiveness and styling. No real focus was put on a11y and SEO.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
